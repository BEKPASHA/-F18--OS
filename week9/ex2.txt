The techniques that reduce miss cost are sub-blocking (allows smaller blocks to be transferred on a
miss), the addition of a second level cache (obviously), early restart/critical word first (allows a miss to
return to the processor earlier), and a write-back buffer (buffers write-backs allowing replacement
blocks to access the bus immediately).
