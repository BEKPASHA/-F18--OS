Physical addresses - the addresses that are available in real memory unit, that physically exist. 

Virtual addresses - addresses generated by the CPU during compile time. These virtual addresses then are mapped to the physical addresses during run time or execution time. We need virtual memory, because physical memory can not accomodate all the programs. CPU can create virtual addresses that can accomodate all the programs, but real memory (physical memory) will contain only subset of virtual addresses, because it is limited.
